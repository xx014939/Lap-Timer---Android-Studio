# Lap-Timer---Android-Studio
This is a lap timer I created in Android Studio using Java. Icons were provided by Iconixar from flaticon.com

This application has two screens, with the first being the "config" screen. Here the user has three options, amount of laps, length of lap 
time, and finally length of rest time.

In the next screen the user is able to begin the timer by pressing play. At the end of each lap the laps remaining number is adjusted and
the rest timer begins.

Whilst the rest timer is playing the control buttons are not available.

Once the lap timer returns, so do the control buttons. These buttons (from right to left) play, pause and reset the timer.

On the completion of all laps the timer turns into the "FINISH" text.
